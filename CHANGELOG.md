* Added Discord Game Invites (intended to replicate the behaviour of old Origin game join offers), these don't support Northstar or listen servers yet, only Vanilla
* Vanilla compatibility doesn't check serverfilter anymore, improving perf hopefully and also resolving weird Out Of Sync disconnects
* Various script fixes
* Auth shouldn't randomly fail on Northstar anymore, also made it use the service text box
* Fixed Colony not showing up on private match UI for private matches
* Fixed weapon settings not updating on switching NS <-> Vanilla
* `weapon_reparse` is no longer cheat protected
